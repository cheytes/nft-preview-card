## My Process

### Built with

- HTML markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned 

This challenge introduced me to many cool, yet small things but my favorite are:

- Centering elements

```css
.flex-on-em {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center; /* horizontally aligned */
    align-items: center; /* vertically aligned */
}

.marg {
    margin: 0 auto;
}
```

- Height of the browser 

```css
.widee {
    height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development 

Working with the svg was a bit challenging, so i'll work on that area in future projects. 

### Useful resources 

- [Flexbox froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - this helped me with centering my card.
